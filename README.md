Background
Ecotourism is an important segment of the tourism industry, emphasizing environmental conservation and responsible travel. However, fluctuations in the economy significantly impact this sector, influencing demand, resource management, and sustainability efforts. This project employs Transformer models to predict economic changes and analyze their effects on ecotourism.

Objectives
Analyze the key economic factors influencing ecotourism.
Build a Transformer-based model to predict economic fluctuations.
Provide insights into how to improve ecotourism management for long-term sustainability.
Methodology
Data Collection: Collect economic and ecotourism data from reliable sources.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data for model training.
Modeling: Use Transformer models to predict economic fluctuations.
Analysis: Analyze the model's predictions and identify key impact factors.
Recommendations: Propose management strategies based on the findings.
